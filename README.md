# 3D Image Carousel Slider

This project showcases a 3D image carousel slider built entirely with HTML and CSS. The slider rotates images in a 3D space, creating an interactive and visually engaging effect. The functionality of the project is enhanced with smooth animations and perspective transformations, all controlled using CSS.

## Features

- **3D Image Slider**: The slider rotates images in a circular pattern using CSS `transform` and `perspective`.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile views.
- **Pure CSS Animations**: All animations and transformations are done with CSS, no JavaScript required.
- **Customizable Image Count**: You can easily adjust the number of images in the slider by modifying the HTML and CSS variables.
- **Background Styling**: The background features a grid-like pattern and an additional image overlay to enhance the visual aesthetics.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations, including CSS Grid, Flexbox, and 3D transformations.
  - **Key CSS Properties**:
    - `perspective`: Gives the 3D depth to the image carousel.
    - `transform`: Rotates and positions the images.
    - `@keyframes`: Creates the continuous rotation effect.
    - `media queries`: Ensures the slider is responsive across all screen sizes.
